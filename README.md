At this time, this repo is simply a proof-of-concept of the calculations needed to simulate Fate/Grand Order combat. Personally, I plan to make this into a NuGet package for anyone and everyone to use.

I'm currently writing out test code to provide viable coverage over the methods needed to calculate every aspect of combat.

My personal project after this is to make a node simulator app that takes your servants and puts them to the test to see if your team compositon is worth using in-game.

Thank you [Atlas Academy](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/) for the game data!
